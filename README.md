# **Student Data Interpretation & Visualization**
## Hello, I am [Dipak Chandrakant Mali](https://www.github.com/malidipak), today I have uploaded my semester project. This is one of the best projects I've ever created using the Python programming language.
---
## **Discription**

### Schools and Universities are the foundation of knowledge and an educational body on which students rely upon. Therefore, they need to maintain a proper database of its students to keep all the updated records and easily share information with students. Student Data Interpretation and Visualization is a console based application which manage the student's data in with help of database.

## **About Student Data Interpretation and Visualization**

### _As mentioned above, it is a console-based system where the user has no restrictions on any features. Explaining the system, features include adding new students to a particular branch, removing students from a particular branch, finding students in a particular branch, and viewing a branch-wise list of all students. 
### _And another important feature of this system is the visualization, it gives you a progress graph of the entire batch with all the branches.
### _While adding the record of students, the user has to enter his / her name, roll number, PRN and other details then the system adds the record into the database.
### _It is compiled in VS Code IDE with Python Interpreter.

##  **Student Data Interpretation & Visualization consists of the following features :-**

- ## Display Record 
- ## Insert Record
- ## Visualize Data
- ## Delete Record
- ## About College
- ## About Project
- ## RESET

## **How to run the code?**

### _To run the project, you must have 'Python Interpreter' and 'Oracle' installed on your PC. You must have the 'cx_Oracle' and 'matplotlib' python modules installed to run the code. If you not have such python modules, so you should go with the pip command and install them. Then, extract the zip file from the download section. Then open the 'Student-Data-Interpretation-Visualization-main' folder. Finally, open command prompt or powershell window in that folder and run the command “python main.py” 
### _You must first RESET after running the code. This function creates an environment for the system i.e. it connects the system to the database and sets up the database. In the RESET function you will need to enter your Oracle database name, username and password. This information will then be stored in a permanent file so you do not need to RESET it.
### **NOTE :** If you encounter any errors while executing, you will need to RESET again.
- ### If you don't know your database name, run the following command in your Oracle/sql command line you get the name.
                             SELECT * FROM global_name;

## **How to RESET :**
                                    After run the code
### *Step 1*

## *I also upload 'data.py' file along with the main file. This file insert 50 random records to database for each branch. In case you have check the system so you can run the code and check it.*

## **Some user-defined function which I used in program**

- **connectdatabase()** – This function connect the program with database
- **home()** - This function displays the main screen to perform different activities
- **menu()** – This function displays the list of different branches
- **addrecord()** – This function has been used for add record of student
- **view()** - This function displays the record
- **aboutclg()** – This function gives you information about the college
- **reset()** - This function set environment for the system
- **aboutCommunity()** - This function gives you information about the system
- **viz()** - This function generate the progress graph of student's
- **delrecord()** - This function has been used for delete record of student
